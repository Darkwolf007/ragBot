    "content": "225 \n \nPrepare a soil bed of garden soil whose area should be at least 2.5 sq ft per each \nindividual. Lay the water-loving plant at a distance of one foot from each other laterally and \nlongitudinally. The soil area need not have a regular shape. It can have any shape as long \nas the requisite area is provided. But the level of the soil bed should be uniform so that the \ngrey water will spread over the entire bed and soil over the entire area is available for \ncleaning the water. If there are slopes, water will tend to flow more in the lower areas alone \nand the purification will be incomplete. The plants must receive at least moderate amount \nof sunlight so that they will grow in a healthy manner. \nThe plants should be watered with fresh water for two or three weeks till they take \nroot and are stabilised and then the grey (used) water should be diverted to it in \nprogressively increased volumes over a week. Thereafter, the process is practically self-\nsustaining.  (Drawing 4A) \nIf the treated water is to be physically recovered, a sump has to be built for this \npurpose. The treated water can then be pumped to the relevant compartment of the over-\nhead tank or to an exclusive tank, for flushing. If there is excess of treated water, the \noverflow can be connected to a suitable water recharge structure. (Drawing 4B) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n"
